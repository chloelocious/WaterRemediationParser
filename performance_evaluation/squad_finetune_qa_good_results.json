remediation.4To help balance the nitrogen cycle, various physical, biological,and chemical treatments of nitrate have long been studied.57Compared with these traditional approaches, electrocatalyticnitrate reduction (NO 3RR) is a promising way to removenitrate using renewable electricity without producing asecondary waste stream.8Unlike thermocatalytic nitratereduction, NO 3RR does not require a supply of H 2or otherreducing agents and instead uses electricity to reduce protonsin the aqueous phase to convert nitrate to products such as N 2,NH 3, NO, N 2O, and NH
