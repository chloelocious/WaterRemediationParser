For Pb and Zn, relatively more is removed from the GR ash (experiment 1) than from the VF ash (experiment 2) (73% versus 24% for Zn, 8% versus 2.5% for Pb). The better Pb removal may be explained by a larger percentage of complexation. In experiment 1, Pb was preferentially removed to the anode side, indicating a larger fraction of negatively charged Pb species, e.g. citrate or chloride complexes, whereas in experiment 2, the majority of the removed Pb was found at the cathode side (Pb2+). For Zn, a lower final pH in ash slices in experiment 1 (see Table 4) may explain why more Zn was removed in this experiment. From the batch leaching experiments (Fig. 4) it was found that Zn begins to desorp at pH values below approximately 7.5 when acid (HNO3) is used as desorption agent. In experiment 1, the final pH was slightly below 7.5 in all ash slices, whereas it was higher in experiment 2 (see Table 4). The Cu removal has, on the other hand, been slightly worse in experiment 1 compared to experiment 2 (18% versus 31%), maybe due to less complexation with NH3 as a result of the lower pH values (Cu forms very stable tetra ammine complexes with NH3). In both experiments, the Cr removal is very low (2\u20133%)."}, {"qas": [{"id": "7", "question": "What are the treated pollutants?", "answers": [{"text": "zn are enriched at / near the surface of the fly ash particles. pb sulphates, elemental pb and zn, and zn bromides and silicates", "answer_start": -1}]}], "context": "From characterisation studies of MSWI fly ashes it has previously been found that oxide and chloride phases of Pb and Zn are enriched at/near the surface of the fly ash particles.
