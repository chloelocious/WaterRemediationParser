the NationalAcademy of Engineering, and part of reducing the humanimpact on the nitrogen cycle will require nitrate remediation.4To help balance the nitrogen cycle, various physical, biological,and chemical treatments of nitrate have long been studied.57Compared with these traditional approaches, electrocatalyticnitrate reduction (NO 3RR) is a promising way to removenitrate using renewable electricity without producing asecondary waste stream.8Unlike thermocatalytic nitratereduction, NO 3RR does not require a supply of H 2or otherreducing agents and instead uses electricity to reduce protonsin the aqueous phase to convert nitrate to products such as N 2,NH 3, NO, N 2O, and NH 2OH.9,10Among these products, N 2isconsidered as the most desirable product because of its benignnature
