This treatment is performed in a series of unit operations, resulting in a fly ash by-product."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Fly ash consists of a mixture of particles, condensed gases, chemicals introduced for treatment of the flue gas and reaction products. Due to the presence of leachable heavy metals, high concentrations of soluble salts and residual amounts of hazardous organics (e.g. dioxins), this waste is classified as hazardous and must be treated prior to disposal. There are two different approaches to solving the problem: (a) encapsulation of the hazardous substances or (b) their removal from the waste."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The most commonly used treatment world-wide for this toxic waste is stabilization/solidification, which consists in the addition of cementitious materials and consequent immobilization of the contaminants in a solid matrix. The main disadvantage of this process is the need for additives, which increase the cost and, in some cases, also the volumes to be disposed. In addition, immobilization does not always succeed and the resulting product can still fail regulatory test. But above all, the stabilization/immobilization process does not fit into an environmental sustainable waste management perspective, since it is not a final solution for the waste (after deposition it must continue to be monitored) and does not promote the reuse nor recycling of the waste."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The current work follows the second approach. Its aim is to evaluate the use of the electrodialytic remediation technique for the removal of heavy metals from MSW fly ash. In case the electrodialytic treatment succeeds, the costs of controlled deposition could be avoided and moreover the residue obtained could be reused in new applications which are now out of reach due to the high loads of heavy metals, such as: production of cement, concrete, ceramic and glass; use in road pavement and embankments; application in agriculture as soil amendment; use as sorbent in industry; and for sludge conditioning (Ferreira et al., 2003a)."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Background"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The electrodialytic remediation method was originally developed at the Technical University of Denmark (Ottosen and Hansen, 1992) for remediation of contaminated soil. The waste to be treated is saturated with water (or a solution of specific substances called \u201cassisting agents\u201d) and placed inside the electrodialytic cell. An electric field is applied across the cell, causing the metal ions to migrate towards the electrodes, according to their charges. Selective ion-exchange membranes placed between the compartments prevent the metal ions from reaching the electrodes. Instead, they are accumulated in \u201cconcentration\u201d compartments from where they can be removed. This technique has also been applied with success to the treatment of wood waste (Ribeiro et al., 2000) and biomass ash (Pedersen, 2002). Recently, some studies have been presented on the use of this technique for the treatment of electrostatic precipitator (ESP) fly ash from incineration of municipal solid waste (Pedersen, 2002)."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Theoretically, the electrodialytic remediation of MSW fly ash is possible. Fly ash particles have a porous structure and a solubility of almost 40% (w/w) (Ferreira et al., 2003b). A promising aspect is that the majority of the toxic metals are presumably found on the surface, as chloride compounds. This assumption is based on the fact that during combustion and gas transport, the thermodynamic conditions necessary for the formation of such compounds have occurred (Ferreira et al., 2003b). Since the great majority of chlorides are extremely soluble, the electrodialytic remediation may present good results."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Several conditions must be met for the successful application of this method to this material. Firstly, the solution used to prepare the initial slurry is important. The use of assisting agents during electrodialytic remediation is referred in the literature for different media: soils and waste wood (Ottosen et al., 1998), bioash and ESP fly ash (Pedersen, 2002). Different types of assisting agents can be used. These agents can normally be defined as solubilisation enhancement compounds, which form stable complexes with the substances to be removed. In order to work with the electrodialytic technique, the complexes must be electrically charged, so that they can be mobilized by the electric field. In a previous investigation by Ferreira et al. (2002), several assisting agents were evaluated for heavy metal removal from MSW fly ash: EDTA, ammonium acetate, ammonium citrate and Na-gluconate. According to that study, Na-gluconate presented the best removal efficiencies for both zinc and lead, while performing well for the other metals (cadmium and copper). The same study showed that Na-gluconate presents additional characteristics such as non-toxicity, good performance at high pH values, formation of charged complexes with the metals and reasonable price. Although this pointed out the possibility of using Na-gluconate as an assisting agent in the electrodialytic remediation of fly ash, this substance has not been tested so far in electrodialytic cells. This testing is conducted in the current work."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Another important aspect is the physical design of the electrodialytic cell. Cells can have varying numbers of compartments as well as use different membrane types. This flexibility allows for the development of process-specific designs. For example, migrating ions may either be allowed to deposit on the electrodes, or collected in a chamber by changing from passive membranes to ion-selective membranes. Further design possibilities were recently proposed by Pedersen (2002) to solve issues such as slow remediation rates, formation of precipitates and self-hardening of fly ash, which happened when working with ESP fly ash. This new design consists of a cell in which the sample is continuously stirred."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Materials and methods"}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Experimental design"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Several experiments were conducted under different operational conditions, which can be divided into three groups (see Table 1)."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "A preliminary testing of fly ash's behaviour during electrodialytic remediation without assisting agent was done in group A. Group B refers to experiments in which Na-gluconate was used as assisting agent. B1 and B2 were designed to compare the effect of using two different current intensities (10 and 50 mA), and B2 and B3 compare the effect of two different concentrations for the assisting agent (3% and 22%). B4 is similar to B3 the difference being that the electrolyte solutions in II and IV were replaced every 5 days by a fresh solution, in order to study the removal over time."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Experiments in groups A and B use the traditional cell (S) in which the membranes and number of compartments were chosen according to the objectives of the work, described below.

The incinerator, with a nominal capacity of 2016 tons/day, uses three equal parallel trains of 28 tons/h each and includes a heat recovery system for electricity production. During the incineration, aqueous ammonia is injected into the furnace for NOx removal by selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), followed by the addition in the scrubber of slaked lime and activated carbon for the neutralization of acid gas and removal of heavy metals. Particulates are removed by high-efficiency baghouses. For each tonne of MSW incinerated, 200 kg of bottom ash and 30 kg of fly ash are generated. Fly ashes collected at the boiler, scrubber and baghouses are mixed, resulting in the material used in the current work. The material appears as a fine, white-grey powder. Following collection, the sample was introduced into a rotating drum and homogenized for 1 week, after which it was stored in 5-l plastic containers. Physical and chemical characteristics of MSW fly ash are presented in Tables 2 and 3."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Electrodialytic cell"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Two different types of experimental cells were used in the current work. Cells of type \u201cS\u201d, with a smaller internal diameter of 4 cm and cells type \u201cL\u201d which presented an internal diameter of 8 cm and a stirrer. Both consisted of a Plexiglas cylinder divided transversely into five compartments (Fig. 1): one central compartment (III) in which the sample is introduced at the beginning of the experiment and two compartments on either side: a concentration compartment (II and IV) followed (outwards) by the electrode compartment (I and V).

Similarly, on the other end of the cell, between chambers IV and V there is a an anion-exchange membrane to prevent cations from reaching V. Between the central compartment and those immediately adjacent to it, passive membranes were used. These consisted of a composite paper/fabric filters. This basic experimental arrangement suffered some controlled variations in setups A1 and C. In A1, a cation-exchange membrane was used between III and IV instead of the passive membrane, in order to prevent energy from being wasted on the transport towards the anode of NO3\u2212 from the electrolyte and of OH\u2212 generated at the cathode. In group C, the passive membranes were replaced by ion-exchange membranes (anion-exchange membrane between II and III and cation-exchange membrane between III and IV), to prevent solution in central compartment to move to adjacent compartments due to stirring."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Experimental procedure"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The fly ash sample was prepared by preliminary saturation with either distilled water or an assisting agent for 24 h.

One of the problems identified in A1 was that the sample nearest to the cathode dried during the experiment, with water content decreasing from an initial value of 39% to 7.1% (see Table 1). This may have caused poor dissolution and low transport of ions, therefore hindering or stopping the electrodialytic remediation process. This problem was partly solved in experiment A2, through the replacement of the membrane between compartments III and IV by a passive membrane, which allows the electrolyte solution to cross over from compartment IV into III. The water content at the slice nearest to the cathode at the end of A2 is 44.2%, as opposed to only 7.1% in A1."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Another important aspect is the evolution of pH during the remediation, since it is known that with increasing acidity the solubility of metals increases. The initial fly ash slurry introduced into the cell is alkaline, with pH above 12 (Table 1). At the end of the experiment, the pH is still above 12, even though the electrolytes are kept below 2 throughout the entire process. This is due to a high pH buffering capacity caused by the presence of carbonates and hydroxides."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "As can be seen in Fig. 2, the remediation results were poor: between 2.4% and 5.2% of the metal present in the ash was extracted. Metal mobilization was therefore not effective and the main possible cause was linked to a high pH value of the sample."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "A2 performs slightly better than A1. The reason for this is probably related to the use of the passive membrane in A2, which prevented drying of the sample, thus increasing efficiency."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Experiments A1 and A2 showed that when working at this high pH mobilisation of metals is low because the metals are present as insoluble compounds. Lowering pH would require large amounts of acid to compensate for fly ash's high buffering capacity. Therefore, Na-gluconate, which can solubilize metals at high pH, was chosen as assisting agent for the experiments in group B at pH 12."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Two operational problems were observed in group B experiments (with Na-gluconate). The first problem was the formation of a white precipitate in compartment IV, which deposited on all surfaces in contact with this solution (tubes, pump, membranes, etc.). This deposition, caused by the high pH in the electrolyte, lead to clogging of the membranes, making it necessary to replace them periodically. The second problem was a partial dissolution of the sample inside the cell, followed by a collapse of the material, creating a lower resistance pathway for the current in the upper part of the cell, allowing it to bypass the sample. This leads to decreased remediation efficiencies."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The percentage of heavy metals extracted in group B appears in Fig. 3. Contrary to what was expected based on batch extractions tests with Na-gluconate and water (see Fig. 4), the use of Na-gluconate as assisting agent did not enhance the remediation significantly. Metal removal improved slightly when compared to group A experiments (Fig. 2), but it is still low compared to the total mass of metals present. The best removal ratio is for Cd, with approximately 10%. It is possible that parts of the studied metals are included in the precipitate and consequently are not accounted for, partially explaining the poor results. The advantage of using the electrodialytic procedure against simple fly ash washing/leaching is that the metals are removed from the sample as soon as they are solubilised due to the electromigration, whereas in leaching/washing they remain in contact with sample, hindering further solubilisation due to saturation of sample. Therefore, in order to be effective, treatments based on leaching/washing require much higher liquid to solid ratios (L/S) and also longer treatment times. Moreover, the high volume of water used in leaching/washing dilute the metals, making it difficult to further capture and recover the heavy metals from solution and creating a new problem related to the treatment of the waste water. On the contrary, during the electrodialytic treatment, metals are being continuously transferred from the central compartment (sample) into \u201cconcentration\u201d compartments, resulting in less volume of a more concentrated, and therefore easier to treat, solution."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Effect of increasing the concentration of the assisting agent"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "As can be seen from Fig. 3, the amount of heavy metals extracted from the sample increases with the concentration of Na-gluconate: extractions with 3% Na-gluconate (B1 and B2) are approximately half of those with 22% Na-gluconate (B3 and B4). Although it is not possible to define the optimum concentration for the Na-gluconate based on these experiments, the importance of this parameter is clearly showed. Optimization of Na-gluconate concentration is recommended for future work."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Effect of using higher current intensities"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "A comparison between the first two columns in Fig. 3 highlights the difference between using a 10 mA current (B1) and 50 mA current (B2). For zinc, the results were similar with both current values; for lead and cadmium, results were better using 50 mA; copper extractions were better with 10 mA. Results are therefore inconsistent, making it impossible to reach a conclusion on the effect of increasing the current intensity. Alshawabkeh et al. (1993) use electric current densities in the order of a few tens of milliamperes per square centimeter, which are higher than the values used in current work (0.8\u20134 mA/cm2). However, Hamed and Bhadra (1997) refer to the use of lower current density, between 0.123 and 0.615 mA/cm2. Pedersen (2002) uses values for current densities of the same order of magnitude as in the current work (0.8 mA/cm2). According to Alshawabkeh et al. (1993), the appropriate current density and electric field strength depends on the electrochemical properties of the sample to be treated: the higher the conductivity, the higher the electric current density must be to maintain the electric field strength required. The same author estimates the necessary electric field strength to be in the order of 50 V/m, which is about two times the values in the current work."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Time evolution of the extraction"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Data collected in experiment B4 makes it possible to assess the mass of metal that reaches the concentration compartments (II and IV) over time (Fig. 5)."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Fig. 5 shows that more than 40% of all metals removed are extracted during the first five days. Between days 5 and 10, extraction proceeds, but at a slower rate, as is clearly shown by the reduced slope in this period. From the 10th day onward, extraction increases again, although not as fast as during the first 5 days."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "These results indicate that remediation is fast in the first 5 days, where a highly mobile fraction is available and removed rapidly. The process then slows down until the less mobile fraction begins to reach the concentration compartments, which happens from day 10 onward. On the cathode side, a reduced extraction rate can be seen for the last 5 days, for Zn, Pb and Cu, with the curve almost leveling out. This slowing down of extraction is not seen on the anode side, thus indicating that prolonging the remediation time could result in additional removal."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Group C experiments tested a different cell design, which had an agitator in the central compartment. The pH inside the compartment III oscillated between 12.03 and 12.32. A precipitate appeared once again."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Fig. 6 presents the extraction results of experiment C. Remarkably, the Pb extracted in C1 reached 30.7%. Since this result was so unlike the previous experiments, C1 was repeated and the results proved identical. The high value obtained for Pb was related to the amphoteric behavior of this metal, with solubility increasing for very acidic or very alkaline media. It is not understood why this only happens in C1 with water and not in C2, which uses Na-gluconate, since in batch extractions at pH around 12, Na-gluconate performed much better than water, as shown in Fig. 4. One possible explanation might be that Pb-gluconate molecules are too big to cross the ion-exchange membrane or they take longer to do so but it is not possible to confirm any of these hypotheses with available data."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Unlike Pb, extraction of the other metals was higher when the assisting agent was used (C2).

Nevertheless, the exploration of these hypotheses requires further study and experimentation."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "In case the electrodialytic treatment succeeds, it could be possible to replace the current stabilization-landfilling procedure by a new approach based on the reuse/recycling of fly ash, now out of reach due to the high loads of heavy metals."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Electrodialytic remediation is expected to work with MSW fly ash.
