This paper investigates the speciation and extent of migration of heavy metals in soils during electrokinetic remediation. Laboratory electrokinetic experiments were conducted using two diverse soils, kaolin and glacial till, contaminated with chromium as either Cr(III) or Cr(VI). Initial total chromium concentrations were maintained at 1000 mg/kg. In addition, Ni(II) and Cd(II) were used in concentrations of 500 and 250 mg/kg, respectively. The contaminated soils were subjected to a voltage gradient of 1 VDC/cm for over 200 h. The extent of migration of contaminants after the electric potential application was determined. Sequential extractions were performed on the contaminated soils before and after electrokinetic treatment to provide an understanding of the distribution of the contaminants in the soils. The initial speciation of contaminants was found to depend on the soil composition as well as the type and amounts of different contaminants present. When the initial form of chromium was Cr(III), exchangeable and soluble fractions of Cr, Ni, and Cd ranged from 10 to 65% in kaolin; however, these fractions ranged from 0 to 4% in glacial till. When the initial form of chromium was Cr(VI), the exchangeable and soluble fractions of Cr, Ni and Cd ranged from 66 to 80% in kaolin. In glacial till, however, the exchangeable and soluble fraction for Cr was 38% and Ni and Cd fractions were 2 and 10%, respectively. The remainder of the contaminants existed as the complex and precipitate fractions. During electrokinetic remediation, Cr(VI) migrated towards the anode, whereas Cr(III), Ni(II) and Cd(II) migrated towards the cathode. The speciation of contaminants after electrokinetic treatment showed that significant change in exchangeable and soluble fractions occurred. In kaolin, exchangeable and soluble Cr(III), Ni(II), and Cd(II) decreased near the anode and increased near the cathode, whereas exchangeable and soluble Cr(VI) decreased near the cathode and increased near the anode. In glacial till, exchangeable and soluble Cr(III), Ni(II), and Cd(II) were low even before electrokinetic treatment and no significant changes were observed after the electrokinetic treatment. However, significant exchangeable and soluble Cr(VI) that was present in glacial till prior to electrokinetic treatment decreased to non-detectable levels near the cathode and increased significantly near the anode. In both kaolin and glacial till, low migration rates occurred as a result of contaminants existing as immobile complexes and precipitates. The overall contaminant removal efficiency was very low (less than 20%) in all tests."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Introduction"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Numerous sites exist in US, where soils have been contaminated with heavy metals such as chromium, nickel and cadmium as a result of improper waste disposal practices in past. Although, several soil remedial technologies have been developed within the last decade, many have proven to be either ineffective or costly for the in situ remediation of clayey soils. In situ electrokinetic remediation (or electrokinetics) has shown to offer significant potential for the remediation of clays contaminated with heavy metals [1\u20136]."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Electrokinetic remediation involves applying a low dc current or a low potential gradient to electrodes that are inserted into the ground and encompass the contaminated zone. Electrolysis reactions generate hydrogen ions (H+) and oxygen gas at the anode and hydroxyl ions (OH\u2212) and hydrogen gas at the cathode. The hydrogen ions in the anode migrate through the soil towards the cathode, whereas the hydroxyl ions in the cathode migrate towards the anode. Depending on the extent of migration of H+ and OH\u2212, pH will vary across the soil. These pH changes affect major physico-chemical processes such as adsorption\u2013desorption, precipitation\u2013dissolution and oxidation\u2013reduction, which dictate partitioning and speciation of the contaminants in soils."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "In order to remove contaminants from soil by electrokinetics, the contaminants should preferably exist in pore water in soluble ionic form so that they are transported to either the cathode or anode depending on the nature of their charge (i.e. cationic or anionic). Four mechanisms are responsible for the transport of contaminants towards the electrodes: electroosmosis, electromigration, electrophoresis and diffusion [6\u20138]. Contaminant transport due to electromigration is one to two orders greater than contaminant transport due to the other mechanisms, therefore, electromigration is considered the dominant transport mechanism for ionic species [7]. The contaminants that are accumulated at the electrodes are eventually extracted by methods such as electroplating (or adsorption onto the electrode) and by pumping water near the electrodes."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Since 1993, research has been on-going at the University of Illinois at Chicago to develop a fundamental understanding of different geochemical processes that occur during electrokinetic remediation and to develop enhancement techniques to induce favorable geochemistry and, in turn, increase remedial efficiency. This research has been specifically focused on clayey soils contaminated with chromium, both with and without co-existing heavy metals, including nickel and cadmium. Laboratory bench-scale experiments were conducted using three different clays, kaolin and Na-montmorillonite (both commercial-grade soils) and glacial till (a field-derived soil) to assess the effect of soil composition on chromium migration under induced electric potential [9]. Experiments were also conducted using kaolin and glacial till to assess: (1) the effect of the initial form of chromium, (2) the synergistic effect of co-contaminants, (3) the effect of naturally occurring reducing agents, and (4) the effect of naturally occurring oxidizing agents on electrokinetic remedial efficiency [10\u201313]. Results revealed that the migration of chromium, nickel and cadmium depends significantly on soil mineralogy. The overall contaminant removal efficiency was controlled by different geochemical reactions, including oxidation\u2013reduction, adsorption, and precipitation. None of these experiments resulted in substantial contaminant removal. Several other studies also reported low removal efficiency due to precipitation of heavy metals due to high pH in the soil near the cathode regions [1\u20136]."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "In order to increase electrokinetic remedial efficiency, the conditioning of electrodes is deemed necessary. Electrode conditioning involves the addition of suitable aqueous solutions into the electrode wells/drains, allowing for their transport into the soils under induced electric potential. The conditioning solutions induce geochemical conditions that favor contaminant migration. In order to develop electrode-conditioning strategies on a rational basis, it is important to assess the forms and distribution of the residual contaminants in soils under induced electric potential without electrode conditioning systems. In this paper, the results of sequential analyses are presented for electrokinetic experiments conducted on two different clayey soils contaminated with chromium, either in the Cr(III) or Cr(VI) form, nickel and cadmium. The forms and distribution of residual contaminants in soils were then determined after electrokinetic treatment.

The high soil pH allows little adsorption of Cr(VI) due to the presence of mostly negatively charged soil surfaces, therefore, the remaining Cr(VI) may have existed as strongly held complexes.

The kaolin possesses low cation exchange capacity (CEC), while the glacial till possesses slightly higher CEC due to the presence of illite (Table 1). This implies that lower amounts of exchangeable heavy metals should be expected in kaolin than in glacial till. However, due to the low pH of kaolin (less than 5), heavy metals existed in soluble form, but they precipitated in glacial till due to high pH (over 7). As a result, more heavy metals exist in exchangeable and soluble form in kaolin than in glacial till. The anionic Cr(VI) species exist mostly in soluble form over a wide pH range, consequently, higher amounts of exchangeable and soluble chromium are found in both soils when Cr(VI) is present. Because Cr(III) exists as hydroxo complexes, its solubility is limited, resulting in low amounts of exchangeable and soluble chromium. The distributions of Ni and Cd are similar, with the exchangeable and soluble fractions slightly lower in the presence of Cr(III), possibly due to their adsorption onto Cr(OH)3 solid aggregates. The heavy metals that are present in the exchangeable and soluble fraction are conducive for migration towards the electrodes during the application of electric potential, therefore, they are indicative of potentially higher remedial efficiencies by the electrokinetic process."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Migration and distribution of heavy metals under induced electric potential"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Due to the induced electric potential, the pH in kaolin with both Cr(III) and Cr(VI) decreased near the anode and increased near the cathode (Fig. 2). These pH changes are due to electrolysis of water at the electrodes due to the induced electric potential. The H+ ions generated at the anode migrate towards the cathode (negative) and OH\u2212 ions generated at the cathode migrate towards the anode (positive), causing the pH of the soil to decrease to a value between 2 and 3 near the anode and to increase between 11 and 12 near the cathode. However, the pH of glacial till for both Cr(III) and Cr(VI) remained relatively high throughout the soil with pH values ranging from 5 to 6 near the anode and from 11 to 12 near cathode (Fig. 2). This is because the H+ ions generated at the anode were neutralized by the high carbonate content, while the OH\u2212 ions migrated from the cathode into the soil to increase the soil pH in the cathode region. The different pH distributions in both soils caused by the induced electric potential will have profound effects on the distribution and migration of the contaminants."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Among the different contaminant transport processes that occur during the application of electric potential, including electroosmosis, electromigration, electrophoresis, and diffusion, the transport of metallic contaminants occurs predominantly through electromigration [7]. The cationic contaminants, Cr(III), Ni(II) and Cd(II), migrate towards the cathode, while the anionic contaminant, Cr(VI), migrates towards the anode. Such a migration of Cr(III), Cr(VI), Ni(II) and Cd(II) in the soils during the electric potential application is evident from the total concentration profiles shown in Figs. 3\u20138. A detailed assessment of the migration behaviors of these contaminants is given elsewhere [13]."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Fig. 3(a) shows the distribution of chromium in kaolin which initially contained all chromium in the Cr(III) form. Chromium existed as hydroxide complexes and precipitates after the application of the electric potential. Exchangeable and soluble Cr(III) fractions migrated towards the cathode. In addition, due to lowering of the soil pH near the anode, chromium hydroxide complexes and precipitates may have solubilized and then migrated towards the cathode. Chromium accumulated near the cathode possibly as hydroxide complexes and precipitates due to increased pH in this region. The chromium thus became immobile, preventing migration to the cathode."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The distribution of chromium in glacial till differed significantly after treatment (Fig. 3(b)). Because of high soil pH initially as well as after the electrokinetic treatment, chromium remained as hydroxide complexes and precipitates.

The presence of chromium in immobile form prevented migration to the cathode during the application of the electric potential."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The distribution of chromium in kaolin and glacial till when initially present as Cr(VI) is shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), respectively. The distribution is drastically different from that observed when chromium was initially present as Cr(III). Because of the anionic nature of Cr(VI), it exists predominantly in exchangeable and soluble form and was able to migrate towards the anode in both kaolin and glacial till. Most of the chromium present in the cathode region migrated towards the anode in both soils. In kaolin, migration of Cr(VI) towards the anode is retarded due to the high adsorption of Cr(VI) onto the soil surfaces at low pH conditions. Also, Cr(VI) was partially reduced into Cr(III) in the anode region, forming hydroxo complexes [13]. However, in glacial till, chromium migration towards the anode was significant due to low adsorption of Cr(VI) as a result of high soil pH. The chromium that accumulated near the anode region existed as the exchangeable and soluble fraction as well as tightly held complexes and precipitates. A partial reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) may have been responsible for the formation of precipitates in the anode region [13]. The amount of Cr(VI) reduction to Cr(III) was higher in glacial till as compared to that observed in kaolin, resulting in higher amounts of immobile hydroxo complexes and precipitates near the anode. These results show that application of electric potential for extended periods may allow the removal of chromium that is present in exchangeable and soluble form, however, residuals may remain as immobile complexes and precipitates."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the distribution of Ni(II) in the presence of Cr(III) remaining in kaolin and glacial till, respectively following electrokinetic treatment. In kaolin, Ni was removed from sections near the anode and accumulated near the cathode. This indicates that exchangeable and soluble Ni easily migrated from the anode region. In addition, due to lowering of soil pH in the anode region, Ni that existed as hydroxo complexes may have solubilized, resulting in additional migration towards the cathode. The accumulated Ni in the cathode region mostly existed as hydroxo complexes and precipitates due to increased pH, thus migration into the cathode was restricted. The extended application of the electric potential would not have caused migration of Ni into the cathode. fractions II to V indicate that some of the Ni complexes/precipitates may be easily soluble with lowering of pH, while the others may be strongly held. The distribution of Ni in glacial till is quite different from that observed in kaolin (Fig. 5(b)). Initially Ni was distributed as hydroxo complexes/precipitates with no exchangeable fraction present. The soil pH remained high even after the application of the electric potential, thus the distribution of Ni did not change. Because Ni existed in immobile forms, no migration into the cathode occurred."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The effects of chromium either in the Cr(VI) or Cr(III) form on Ni distribution after the application of electric potential are negligible (Figs. 5(a), 5(b), 6(a) and 6(b)). Ni that existed in exchangeable and soluble form in kaolin migrated towards the cathode and then existed as immobile hydroxo complexes/precipitates. In glacial till, Ni was distributed as hydroxo complexes/precipitates initially and this distribution was unaffected by the application of electric potential.Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the distribution of Cd in kaolin and glacial till, respectively when these soils contained Cr(III). The Cd distribution in both soils is similar to that observed for Ni. In kaolin, exchangeable and soluble Cd migrated from the anode regions and then accumulated in the cathode region. Because of high pH, Cd near the cathode existed as precipitates, but a significant amount of Cd also existed in exchangeable and soluble form. The presence of the latter fraction may be attributed to the higher solubility of Cd and also competitive adsorption/precipitation of Ni as compared to Cd [18]. In glacial till, Cd existed mostly as hydroxo complexes/precipitates. A small amount of Cd that was initially present as exchangeable and soluble fraction did not migrate under induced electric potential. Although, small amounts of the exchangeable and soluble fraction were present near the anode, it was not present in the sections near the cathode due to increased pH.
