Since removal rate by this media decreases by time and due to the high costs of excavation and replacement of new media, the usage of activated carbon as an adsorbent in PRB is limited. The present study aimed to solve this defect by integrating electrokinetic process and PRB, using in-situ regeneration of activated carbon. This research was carried out on a laboratory scale using synthetically contaminated water and modified activated carbon as a reactive media in PRB. The effects of pH, nitrate concentration, carbon to sand ratio, and also electric gradient on the performance of the process were evaluated, and optimal conditions were determined, to increase the system longevity. According to the results, by applying an electric gradient of 1.25\u202fV\u202fcm\u22121 to the PRB alone process in optimum operating condition (135\u202fmg\u202fL\u22121 initial nitrate concentration, flow rate of 2.3\u202fL min\u22121, pH\u202f=\u202f6.8, and carbon to sand ratios of 1:1) the adsorbent capacity increased by 90%. Under these conditions, the integrated process could keep nitrate concentration in the effluent below the standard limit for about 111\u202fh, while the PRB alone process could do the same job for about 59\u202fh. Also, SEM analysis showed that by applying electrokinetic process, activated carbon was regenerated. Integration of electrokinetic process and PRB was also caused nitrate to transfer from activated carbon media into the soil layer above the system. This nitrate-rich soil has the potential for reuse in agricultural activities."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Introduction"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Aquifers are often protected by soil layers and sediments. However, this protection may not be effective in some cases, where the intrusion of contaminated stream can pollute groundwater. Depending on the characteristics of soil and the properties of the water which is leaking into soil layers, streams are formed through which contaminants enter aquifers constantly. According to the estimates of the US Environmental Protection Agency, there are thousands of contaminated groundwater sites in this country, more than 217,000 of which need emergency remediation (Hadley and Newell, 2012)."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "In the past, groundwater has been a hidden source of water. Thus, its pollution was often less attended. However, nowadays the vulnerability potential of groundwater resources has been widely considered, and strict rules and restrictions have been applied, in this regard. Today, the amount of pollutants in water resources has increased to a level that exceeds the self-purification capacity of these resources. This is a serious threat to consumers' health. In recent years, groundwater quality has decreased dramatically in many urban areas, due to the increasing consumption of soluble chemicals, as well as the increasing domestic and industrial wastewater discharged into the aquifers (Lapworth et al., 2012)."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Nitrate ion is one of the most important pollutants in groundwater resources. Due to its high solubility, it is very costly to remove this pollutant from drinking water. Apart from the natural cycle of nitrogen, nitrate enters the water and soil resources via human wastewater, urban and industrial wastes and agricultural activities. This affects the health of consumers adversely (Ganesan et al., 2013). Body-absorbed nitrate has negative effects on humans, especially in newborns and pregnant women. The nitrate in drinking water is reduced to nitrite, and eventually to N-nitroso in body, which is a highly toxic and carcinogenic compound (Gilchrist et al., 2010; Gangolliet al, 1994). Generally, the entrance of nitrate into body and the subsequent reduction of it can have short and long term effects. Methemoglobinemia, negative effect on embryo and the carcinogenization of nitrate are among the most important effects of entrance of this compound into human body."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Permeable Reactive Barrier (PRB) is one of the innovative technologies used for the remediation of contaminated groundwater.

The PRB implementation involves embedding a reactive media across the flow path of the contaminated groundwater. As contamination plume is affected by a natural hydraulic gradient and passes through the media, the contaminants in the plume react with the media. This reaction results in the transformation of pollutants into less harmful compounds or the fixation of them in the reactive media (Skinner and Schutte, 2006)."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Activated carbon, mostly in granular form, is one of the most commonly used materials in PRBs. The removal of contaminants in this media is mainly due to sorption (Bone, 2012). Especially in the case of mineral contaminants, Activated Carbon (AC) has a very high sorption capacity (Hashim et al., 2011). Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) as a reactive media has a great performance in removing nitrate from groundwater. However, its being expensive has severely restricted its usage as an adsorbent in developing countries (Daoud et al., 2016). Therefore, it is not affordable to replace GAC, when it is saturated and deactivated in the media. For this reason, it is necessary to find an in-site method to regenerate GAC."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Electrokinetic process is one of the technologies used in the field of soil remediation.

Experimental results showed that the integrated system of PRB-EK more effectively removed fluorine than the EK process (Zhou et al., 2016).
