The treatment zone is constructed using different reactive materials, like granular iron [2], atomizing slag [3], and activated carbon [4]; as by passing through the permeable barrier, some contaminants are degraded, adsorbed or precipitated, depending on the used reactive material. Aluminum drinking water treatment residuals (Al-WTRs) are waste by-products from the drinking water treatment process which are produced daily and in large quantities at most municipalities worldwide. Nowadays in Japan, Al-WTRs are produced as a result of the addition of polymeric aluminum salts (PAC) to raw water in order to remove colloids, silt and clay-size particles and color. Some preliminary studies found that Al-WTRs were able to be an adsorbent to remove heavy metal ions such as Cd, Pb, Zn [5], As [6], Hg [7] and Sb [8] ions from water, suggesting that Al-WTRs might have a capacity to immobilize these metal ions. However, the potential application of a remediation system that couples the electrokinetic (EK) remediation with Al-WTRs as an entrapping zone (EZ) for the removal of lead from soil has never been tested and discussed. Fig. 1a shows a schematic diagram of the in situ EK remediation, which requires a pumping system at the cathode to transport the contaminant flux migrated from the anode towards the cathode due to the combined effects of electro-osmosis and electro-migration. Meanwhile, an EK system employing EZ coupled with EK is an alternative to traditional system of pump and treat, which represent an innovative and cost effective technology for in situ treatment of groundwater. Fig. 1b shows an EK system combined with EZ, which is placed across the flow path of a contaminated plume. As the plume flows through the EZ under EK process, contaminants are entrapped, immobilized and deposited there without soil excavation and groundwater pumping. The major features of the technology are (1) electrode energized by the a direct current, which causes water and soluble contaminants to move into or through the entrapping zone; (2) entrapping zones containing reagents that decompose the soluble organic contaminants or adsorb contaminants for immobilization or subsequent removal and disposal; (3) a water management system that recycles the water accumulates at the cathode back to the anode for acid\u2013base neutralization [9]."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "In this study, the feasible application of the EK remediation coupled with Al-WTRs as an EZ was investigated to remediate lead from contaminated kaolinite clay soil. This system includes two treatment process. First is the EK process, where lead ions are removed from contaminated kaolinite clay soil by electro-migration and electro-osmotic flow, and the metal ions are introduced into the Al-WTRs zone by electrokinetic process. Second is Al-WTRs zone process, where lead ions will be entrapped, immobilized and deposited. In addition, the soil characteristics including pH, redox potential and also current that pass through the soil during and after the completion of treatment are measured for understanding the features of the innovative technique. It is expected that the results reported in this study would provide some useful information for remediation of lead contaminated sites."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Experimental"}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Collection and characterization of Al-WTRs"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The two kinds of Al-WTRs sample were collected from the Miyamachi and Nishino drinking water purification plant in Sapporo city, Hokkaido, Japan. In these plants, Al-WTRs are produced subsequent the addition of aluminum-based polymer (i.e. polyaluminum chloride) as a coagulant for removing organic matter and metallic contaminants. Other chemicals including Na2CO3 and NaHClO4 are also used for pH control and disinfection. The black appearance in Nishino Al-WTRs was due to the addition of activated carbon to remove odor compounds from water. The Al-WTRs used in this study were collected from an open disposal site located next to the water treatment facility, where the sludge was stabilized for one year. The Al-WTRs were dried in the oven at 80 \u00b0C for a period of one month. Homogeneous material was obtained by passing Al-WTRs through a 500 \u03bcm screen. The pH and electrical conductivity (EC) of Al-WTRs were measured in 1:4 (mass/volume) water suspensions, after equilibration period for 4 h using a pH meter (Horiba D-54, Japan) as described in the paper [7]. The percentage composition of C, H, N in Al-WTRs were measured using elemental analysis apparatus (Corder MT-6, Japan). The point zero charge (pHPZC) and buffer capacity were determined for each Al-WTRs sample by the acid\u2013base titration method as described in Faria et al. [10] and Vazquez et al. [11], respectively. For total metal analysis, about 0.5 g of dry Al-WTRs sample was digested overnight at 110 \u00b0C with 10 mL of HNO3/H2SO4 mixture (7:3, v/v) in a closed Teflon\u00ae vessel and then the supernatant was then measured for the total concentration of Al, Fe, Cd, and Pb by ICP-MS (HP 4500, Yokogawa Analytical System). In addition, Al-WTRs were examined via scanning electron microscopy (JSM 6360 LA, JEOL), Fourier transform infrared (JS 460, JASCO) and X-ray diffraction (Seifert-XRD 3000). An emphasis in the characterization of Al-WTRs was on the measurement of the specific surface area (SSA), a key parameter that strongly influences the sorption capacity of solid surfaces [12]. The SSA was measured by nitrogen adsorption (SSA-N2 at 77 K) methods using a ASAP2010 (Micromeritics Corp., USA).

The other set was also prepared by similar procedure, in which the lead concentration was 500 mg/L and the pH of solution was designated as pH 2\u201312 in order to investigate the effect of pH on adsorption behavior. The mixture was then mechanically agitated for promoting adsorption for over 12 h. After adsorption, the equilibrated samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 rpm and then the supernatant was taken and analyzed for the lead concentration.

The chemical properties of kaolinite clay soil had been reported in our previous study [2,14]. A series of bench-scale EK experiments were conducted using a clear acrylic box oriented horizontally as shown in Fig. 2. The testing box consists of three major parts, a soil cell and two electrode compartments. The soil cell (15 cm \u00d7 2 cm \u00d7 3.5 cm) was containing soil specimen where connected to the electrode compartments in both ends. Graphite and stainless steel 316 electrodes were used for the cathode and anode, respectively. The installed positions of entrapping zone of Al-WTRs were varied (i.e. the position near to the anode around 6.0 cm away from the anode, in middle of the soil cell, and near to the cathode around 6.0 cm away from cathode). Contaminated soil with 190 mg/kg Pb(NO3)2 was filled in part of the soil cell prior to the EZ system and the part of the clean soil behind the EZ system set as a clean zone. One set of experiment without EZ served as a blank set. In this study, 0.1 M acetate buffer solution of pH 3.8 was used throughout the experimental works as a purging solution since the buffer concentration at the appropriate pH has been determined to be adequate with the aim of removal lead ion from soil [15]. A 1.0 V/cm of potential gradient was applied for 72 h experimental and the electric currents were monitored during the test periods using midi logger (GL200A, Graphtec). The soil sample was sectioned into five parts after the completion of each test, and the lead ion was extracted from soil by acid digestion (e.g. 5 g soil was mixed with 50 mL of 0.1 M HCl and then shaking for 12 h). The concentration of lead ion in the supernatant was determined by flame-atomic absorption spectrophotometry, except for Al which is measured by 15 min aluminon methods [16]."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Results and discussion"}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Characterization of Al-WTRs"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The physicochemical compositions of the dewatered Al-WTRs are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that aluminum is dominant component in the dewatered sludge with more than 70% in mass. The concentration of lead in the sludge is quiet lower than the other heavy metals, and its concentration was far below from the environmental quality standard for lead contaminated soil in Japan (i.e. 150 mg/kg). Another major component in Nishino sludge is carbon due to additional of activated carbon during the drinking water process. The properties of such Al-WTRs are highly variable and dependent on both the type of raw water and the chemical composition of coagulant that was added during water treatment process [17]. The quantify of buffering capacity of the different Al-WTRs samples is represented by plotting the dlog\nVNaOH added and the dlog\nVNaOH added versus dpH (the curves are not shown). The slopes of the curves indicated that the larger the slopes are, the smaller the buffer capacity is. The calculated slopes show that both of Al-WTRs have a strong buffering capacity against the acid (e.g. d(log\nVHCl added)/dpH) = \u22120.781 for Miyamachi and \u22120.762 for Nishino), but the pH changed slightly when base was added to the Al-WTRs from Nishino. Therefore, it seems to have any quiet lower buffer capacity compared with that of Al-WTRs from Miyamachi (e.g. d(log\nVNaOH added)/dpH) = \u22120.399 for Miyamachi and \u22120.328 for Nishino). A high amounts of heavy metals are retained in solution when the buffer capacity is high enough to resist a change in the pH soil into the alkaline condition [18,19]. The solution pH at which the surface of a soil particle carries no charge is called the point of zero charge (PZC). The reported PZC values of kaolinite clay used in this study lies approximately in pH 4.15 [20]. At pH above the PZC value, the clays carry the overall negative charges in suspension [21]. Since the pHPZC of Al-WTRs samples is higher than that of kaolinite clay, the adsorption of lead ion into the entrapping zone is expected to increase with the decrease of pH in the soil pore solution. The images obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the collected Al-WTRs are heterogeneous mixture of particles with irregular shape and variables size and the classical well-crystalline appearance has not been found on sludge surface (see Fig. 3c and d). The image of Nishino's Al-WTRs (Fig. 3d) showed a particle shapes appearance like activated carbon (Fig. 3e). The result of X-ray diffraction pattern (XRD) (figure is not shown) illustrated no sharpening characteristic diffraction peaks over a broad range of d-spacing (15\u201370\u00b0, 2\u03b8), indicating poorly ordered particle of the Al-WTRs. This observation is also in agreement with other papers [22,23]. Although both the XRD and the SEM are rather qualitative descriptions on Al-WTRs structure, it is reasonable to believe that the Al-WTRs are really amorphous. Table 1 show that the surface area and pore volume of Al-WTRs from Nishino is higher than that of Miyamachi probably due to containment of activated carbon. Another range of surface area of Al-WTRs material have been reported from the measurement on the adsorption to be 48 \u00b1 0.3 m2/g [7], the Al-WTRs used herein can be considered to have a comparatively higher surface area, particularly the Nishino one (Table 1). Makris et al. found that Al-WTRs have surface area up to105 m2/g. Furthermore, the surface area of the Al-WTRs was found to increase with the increased particle size by rising large inner porosity in the grains [24]."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Adsorption characteristic of lead ion on Al-WTRs in aqueous phase"}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Adsorption capacity"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The adsorption behavior of lead ions on the Al-WTRs is crucial to understand the partition and mobility in sludge. Fig. 4a shows the experimental data for adsorption of lead ions at the different equilibrated concentrations of lead ions in a Al-WTRs suspension (i.e. 1:10, w/v). The shape of the obtained adsorption isotherm suggest that the adsorption sites of Al-WTRs have a high affinity for lead ions, the adsorbed amount of lead ions increased with the increase of the lead ions equilibrium concentration over the range of the concentration studied. The adsorption data was fitted well with the Langmuir behavior as shown in Fig. 4b. The maximum adsorption capacity of Al-WTRs determined from the Langmuir model was 17.55 mg/g for Miyamachi and 15.86 mg/g for Nishino (Table 2). These adsorption capacities for lead are considerably larger than that of the waste adsorbents previously tested, for example the by-products of steel making industry and agriculture waste have a maximum sorption capacity of 2.74 mg/g and 14.35 mg/g [25,26], respectively. Additionally, the favorable nature of adsorption process can be expressed in terms of a dimensionless constant separation factor (R) defined as R\n= 1/(1 +\nKLC0), where C0 is the initial lead concentration (mg/L) and KL is the binding constant from Eq. (1). The calculated (R) values in this study were less than 1 and greater than 0, indicating a favorable adsorption [27]. Langmuir isotherm is based on the assumption of a single monolayer adsorption sites on a homogeneous surface (e.g. all sites on the adsorbent have the same affinity for the adsorbate) [13]. This model fitted well to these short-term adsorption experiments, where the adsorption of lead ions was limited to the external surface sites but not the internal sites [27]. However, since Al-WTRs are micro-porous adsorbent, there is also the possibility for the intra-particle diffusion of metal ion into the micro-pores [7,21]. Therefore, it is likely that the true adsorption capacity of Al-WTRs is even greater than the value obtained in these short-term adsorption experiments."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "pH dependence on adsorption capacity"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The pH is a key parameter governing the surface charge of solid material [28]. Fig. 5 shows that in the plain condition (i.e. the pH of solution is about 5 \u00b1 0.5), both of Al-WTRs samples have an ability on the adsorption of about 80\u201385% lead ions from solution. However, in the concentration of lead below 500 mg/L, almost 100% of removal has been achieved. Fig. 5b shows that the surface adsorption of Al-WTRs is strongly dependent on pH of solution, the highest Pb2+ removal from aqueous phase was achieved from pH 6 for Miyamachi sludge, while that for Nishino sludge at the pH 4. According to the correlation data between adsorption behavior and measured zeta potential versus pH, it was indicating that the adsorption ability of Al-WTRs to the cations and anions has strong relationship with the nature of the surface sludge [7,23]. For example, as the pH increased from about 4 to 10, the sludge surface leads to the formation of more negatively charged because of acid-dissociation. Therefore, it is making the sludge surface be a comparable high affinity to lead ions. Meanwhile, by the decrease in pH, H+ in the solution competes strongly with Pb2+ for active sites on the sludge surface, which in turn affects the adsorption capacity of the sludge into less adsorption. Considering these adsorption processes, the removal of lead ion from kaolinite clay using Al-WTRs in the EK/EZ system is favored at the lower acidic values (i.e. pH 3\u20136)."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Integration of EK/EZ remediation process"}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Current and soil pH in EK/EZ systems"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "In this study, the constant voltage was applied between the electrodes. The variations of current throughout the EK/EZ operations are shown in Fig. 6. From these figures, it was revealed that the variance of current intensity has significantly correlated to the EZ positions and also a kind of Al-WTRs material. When the EZ was installed near the cathode, the current was high within 20 h operations, and then gradually decreased into a stable after 40 h for Test 4 and 7 (i.e. 2.21\u20132.41 mA for Miyamachi and 1.23\u20131.43 mA for Nishino). Meanwhile, the occurrence of lowest plateau was found for other EZ position near the anode and in the middle position (Test nos. 3, 4, 6 and 7). Furthermore, the low current intensity was found for EK/EZ system with Nishino sludge. The decrease of current intensity with the operation time reflected the increased in the total electric resistance in the EK/EZ system [29]. The increased in the electric resistance during the EK/EZ operation using Nishino sludge resulted from (1) clogging of precipitate of metal hydroxide in the soil matrix or (2) the high density of activated carbon in the EZ will change the penetration of water into the EZ barrier."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The pH distribution in the soil and reservoir was shown in Fig. 6c.

The results showed that there was no evident correlation between soil pHs, the quantity of Al-WTRs materials and the EZ position. However, the pHs profile were quite similar to those observed when activated carbon was used as an entrapping zone in the EK system to remove nickel ion from kaolinite clay [4]."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Effect of Al-WTRs barrier on the EK remediation"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "Fig. 7 shows the amount of lead ion remaining in the each part of the filled soil in the migration cell after 72 h of EK process with and without an EZ. The results show that lead ion was accumulated apparently in the EZ installed during the EK process. In the part of the clean soil set behind the EZ (sec. 5), lead ion was hardly diminished there after EK process. This suggested that the EZ acted as an effective barrier to retain lead ion on the adsorption sites of Al-WTRs. On the other hand, in the EK system without EZ, lead ion was distributed in the clean soil set behind the contaminated soil (sec. 4 and 5)."}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The entrapping capacity and fractional distribution of lead after the EK/EZ system under several different conditions was summarized in Table 3. The entrapping percentages of lead ion in the EZ of Al-WTRs after EK operation for 72 h was around 40\u201360% for Miyamachi and 30\u201335% for Nishino. The increase of processing time until 168 h (Test nos. 9 and 10) and changing the installed position of EZ in the system did not enhance the entrapping capacity of EZ in the system. In the Test no. 8, the increased mass of Nishino sludge for twice of Test no. 7, the entrapping capacity decreased until 3 times. The low entrapping capacity in the case of Nishino sludge seemed to be due to the low current density during the EK operation, that is the high content activated carbon might increase the electric resistance in the EK/EZ system. Also, in this study the lead ion was founded in the effluent solution through the cathode reservoir as a result of the effects of electro-osmosis when the EZ system was installed near to the anode (i.e. Test nos. 2 and 5). The low electro-osmotic flow produced in the Test no. 5 (i.e. 10 mL) in compassion with the Test no. 2 (i.e. 18 mL) resulted in less amount of lead ion migration into the cathode reservoir. Other test where EZ was installed in the different positions in the soil cell has not showed any EOF, which mean that the ionic migration process in the EK/EZ system was dominated by the electro-migration process. These results indicate that lead in the soil was dissolved as an exchangeable ionic species when using 0.1 M acetate buffer of pH 3.8 as purging solution."}, {"type": "Heading1", "content": "Aluminum leachability from EZ on the EK process"}, {"type": "Paragraph", "content": "The aluminum (Al) leachability from Al-WTRs during the EK process has rise a several problem for the EK/EZ system using those materials which we have to consider.

The leaching concentration of aluminum from Miyamachi sludge did not depend on the position of EZ in the system, it was about 0.020\u20130.024 mg/g. Meanwhile, the aluminum leaching from Nishino sludge depended largely on the position of the installed EZ from anode to cathode, which is gradually aluminum leaching from 0.102\u20130.024 mg/g.
